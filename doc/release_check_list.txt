# Release check-list for HearthstoneTracker

## Terminology

Branches:

- release/*: Stable branch, source from latest published release
- master: Unstable branch, latest source for next release

Releases:

 - Major: 1.x.x.x -> 2.x.x.x Do not use :p
 - Minor: x.1.x.x -> x.2.x.x Increment manually when creating a new minor release
 - Patch: x.x.1.x -> x.x.2.x Increment manually from a release branch
 - Build: x.x.x.1 -> x.x.x.2 Incremented by the build server (AppVeyor)

 
## Notes

Major, minor and patch components of the version have to be increased manually (in appveyor.yml and Version.txt).  Build number is generated by AppVeyor.

Every minor version has their own branch, named 'release/<version>' (e.g. release/1.10)

Patches (revisions) are applied on and released from their release branch.
